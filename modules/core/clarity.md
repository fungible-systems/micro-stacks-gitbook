# Clarity

### What is Clarity?

Clarity is a smart contract language for Bitcoin that runs on the Stacks blockchain. `micro-stacks` provides an intuitive interface for interacting with Clarity via JavaScript.

Clarity has a number of advantages that make it easy for developers to create expressive contracts that execute predictably and safely. Here are a few of the highlights:

* Clarity code is published directly to the blockchain without being compiled, i.e., it's an _interpreted_ language
* _Overflow / underflow guards_ ensure a transaction will automatically abort rather than continue to execute chaotically
* _Strongly typed_ with no type mixing means variables can only store values of the correct type
* No smart contract anti-features, such as Turing Completeness, which means Clarity is _decidable_
* Custom _fungible_ and _non-fungible tokens (NFTs)_ are built-in primitives in the language
* Contracts can natively read the state of the Bitcoin settlement layer and use _Bitcoin transactions_ as a trigger&#x20;
* Transactions can be secured by [_Post Conditions_](clarity/post-conditions.md) which enforce a pre-defined end state for any token transfers that end users can view prior to execution
